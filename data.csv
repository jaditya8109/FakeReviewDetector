I think this model is one of the best from boat in this range. The only earphone that "might" be better is the one from realme. but i wanted to buy an non-chinese.Pros:Battery and fast charging: the battery lasted me for 15 hours. Volume is loud, so Ibarely used more than 30% of the max volume.Sound:Unlike other boat products, this isn't extreme bass heavy, which usally lead to poor trable sounds in those earphones. Also EQ is good. you can easily enjoy mettalic and violin music without the use of an equalizer.Noise cancellation: dont use both sides while on the road.Cons:Connevtivity Issue: on the 4th image you can see a white light. the earphone hanged/crashed and it remained like that for 10 minutes. It started working after I plugged it into charging.Sometimes even after pairing, theres no audio, or it misses audio in between. It is resolved after re-pairing.Dual Connectivity: When connected to 2 devices, and one device starts to go out of range, the earphone starts beeping every 2 seconds and its kinda annoyingBatter percentage: Battery decrease is shown as 100% or 80% or 60% and then directly to 20%Boat website: as of writing this review, the product is not mentioned on boat's page for REGISTRATION of the product.latency: there's a little noticable delay "sometime" of less than half a second. irs it's usually rare.Read more
Purchased thisheadphone on 6th August and was delivered on 8th August. Have been using it since 2 days.My findings are it has a decent sound quality with medium bass. Battery lasts for 12-15 hours as mentioned.. Dual pairing works perfectly.Call quality is ok. Though I found the receiver may hear the voice little low. Bluetooth range is not more than 6-7 metres.The main problem is with the battery indicator. The battery indicator drops to 80%, 60% , to 20% directly and then to 0. It doesn't decrease in serial order from 100,99,98 and so on. Those who have checked my review and have bought the headphone can please check the same if they also have this issue with their headphone.. I may need to replace it if I am the only one having this issue. Thank you.Read more
Got this product on prime day itself,Pros:1) It has a great inbuild quality2) Which is having a water repellent feature and additional to this it can access your phone assistance by simply just double click on power button3) Great microphone quality4) Rapid connectivity with dual paring5) Fast charging6) Jumbo battery life7) Switch bass mode to sterio mode through a button.8) Non slippery designCons:1) The buds were quite weak at its gripFinally a worthful product, which you can get it on reliable price, i've got this for 1,490 rs, i donno what will be the price when it arrives again, but for the price than i've got is completely worth.Read more
Very cheap quality of earpiece and wire.The wire get bent when you put the neck band on you which causes the possibility of breaking.It also gives the static sound like 'srrrrrrr' when not in use. No doubt the battery life is too good but this is the only plus point (no other good feature except battery).Sound quality is decent, not good at this price. I thought boat is a promising brand which will offer a good quality earphones. But, I think Boat 255 pro are much better than these.I'm gonna return these earphones. Not recommended.Read more
Never buy any boat products. Very poor customer service. No guarantee period replacement. There advertisement is pukka cheating. I bought this product during Amazon festival. After 2 weeks of use earbuds got separated. This was made of very poor quality of material. As advertised by Boat, I registered the complaints , in boat website, got the ticket number, but despite waiting for over two months, after numerous follow UPS, no one had arrived to pick the product, neither replaced. Customer service contact email aur phone number are totally irresponsible. NEVER NEVER NEVER BY ANY BOAT PRODUCT . ABSOLUTE CHEATINGRead more
It was a steal deal during prime days. This wireless earphone is equipped with all up to date technologies and features.1. Sound quality:Both bass and balanced EQ modes are nicely optimized. Bass mode produce deep and punchy bass without any distortion even at higher volume (unlike other models) and still it retains the clarity of mids and highs. Balanced mode is also well optimized with balanced mids and highs.My rating: 4.8/52. Battery life: Using for last three days (2-3 hours each day on average) and still 70% battery left. Charged for just 10 minutes. And bang! It's fully charged!My rating: 5/5 (Really impressed but I've to check long time performance)3. Connectivity:Bluetooth 5.0 is super fast. Only drawback is that there is no auto on/off or even play/pause by magnetic detachment of earphones (magnetic attachment is no no use in this earphones).My rating: 4/54. Build quality: Smooth and silicon material at the neck band (it's super flexible, see photo attached) with matte finish, plastic body feels like high quality. Wires could have been better. Earpieces have metal and matte finished plastic materials with super soft buds for comfort. Hooks are there to provide firm grip so that earbuds never fall while running/jogging.My rating: 4.2/5Read more
Low-quality product. I was amazed with its quality. The moment I received this product left earplug was not working. Soon after that I found a connectivity issue. Overall a big NO for the product.Being a newly launched product, such issues were not expected.You can get better wireless earphones at this cost.Read more
No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.Read more
Thisearphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buyingâ€‹ this unreliable product.Thanks.Read more
i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.Read more
I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!Read more
