So guys I had purchased this neckband considering that it has the button for extra bass, but the actual truth is that noise has cut down the bass and treble totally from the normal mode and when you press the extra bass button it turns on bass and treble which is basically already present in another neckband primarily. So dont fool yourself by considering the multi functional button, has nothing special feature.Read more

I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with itIn this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-ProsðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerableBox Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbudsConnectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.Sound quality:-Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.Cons:-ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡Bass:-ðŸ˜”To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price pointsEar buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesðŸ˜”ConclusionðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability,At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignoreRead more
